Offline movie database

This is an offline movie database for all the movies you would like to see in the future.

Setup:

  All you need to do is to make a folder for the program. In this folder the program will make a my_data.dat file if there wasn't one already. This will contain the list elements. Also you need to have Java installed. When you first start up the program it should show you an empty list, so it's up to you to add your movies in there.

Features:

1.  Addig a movie to the list

  You can add a new movie to your list by entering the title in the search box, choosing a genre from the drop down menu next to the search box and clicking the 'Add' button.
  
2.  Filtering and ordering the movie list

  You can filter or search the list by entering the title in the search box and/or selecting the genre from the drop down menu. Also you can change the ordering of the list by clicking on the column names.
  
3.  Deleting movies from the list

  You can delete the movies from your list by selecting them and clicking the 'Delete selected' button. Multiple titles can be selected at the same time.

4.  Mark seen movies

  You can easily mark the movies you have already seen by clicking on the 'Watched' box in the same row.
